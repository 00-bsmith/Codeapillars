Game Design

Game Start
- Players click a button to start a new game, which brings them to a landing page which waits a set amount of time until beginning
- A timer counts down before the first question

Game Round Design
- A question is displayed on the screen for a set amount of time with the players unable to answer the question (makes it a fair playing field for people who take their time to read the question thoroughly). 
- After the set amount of time has elapsed, players are able to answer the question until the timer at the top of the screen ends. (Wait to display buttons until after the first timer ends? Display buttons before first timer ends, but don't give them functionality? Display buttons immediately, but don't display a submit button until the first timer ends?)
- Award points based on how quickly player answers 
- After timer for question ends, show answer, player's score for that round, and perhaps player's total score as well
- Player's total score should be displayed at the top of the screen for entirety of round 

Game End
- After end of final round, players are directed to a results screen which shows their final score. If multiplayer, rank players by score. 
- Include a table of questions and corresponding correct answers from the round.
- After a set amount of time, two buttons are rendered: one giving the player the option to play again, the other directing them to the home screen (welcome message and leaderboard(s)).

Number of Rounds
-Give players option of 3 different game lengths: 
  -Short: 7 - 3/3/1
  -Medium: 15 - 5/7/3 
  -Long: 30 - 10/15/5

Amount of Time Per Question
- I think that the first timer (for players to read the question) should run at about 5 seconds
- The second timer should run for 15 seconds. If all players have submitted their answers, the round ends early.

Points Per Question
- Kahoot uses the equation (1 - [ (r/q) / 1.2 ]) * p, where r is the time after the question starts, q is the total time given for the question, and p is the number of points you earned for answering the question correctly)
  - p = 100, regardless of difficulty

Tiebreaker
- If tied after last normal rounds, add three additional rounds, one of each difficulty
- If still tied after tiebreaker rounds, call it a draw 

Type of Question
- Multiple choice for now
